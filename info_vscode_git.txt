As a bonus to this section, if you are using Visual Studio Code (and you should be if you’re following this curriculum) 
and you don’t want to get stuck writing a commit message in Vim because you accidentally used git commit without the message flag (-m), 
this command will make Visual Studio Code open a new tab with the ability to write your commit message and an optional description below it: 
git config --global core.editor "code --wait".
